	abstract = {Dialect groupings can be discovered objectively and automatically by cluster analysis of phonetic transcriptions such as those found in a linguistic atlas. The first step in the analysis, the computation of linguistic distance between each pair of sites, can be computed as Levenshtein distance between phonetic strings. This correlates closely with the much more laborious technique of determining and counting isoglosses, and is more accurate than the more familiar metric of computing Hamming distance based on whether vocabulary entries match. In the actual clustering step, traditional agglomerative clustering works better than the top-down technique of partitioning around medoids. When agglomerative clustering of phonetic string comparison distances is applied to Gaelic, reasonable dialect boundaries are obtained, corresponding to national and (within Ireland) provincial boundaries.},

While clustering geographical varieties with respect to their features, e.g. pronunciation, is not new, the simultaneous identiﬁcation of the features which give rise to the geographical clustering presents novel opportunities in dialectometry. Earlier methods aggregated sound differences and clustered on the basis of aggregate differences. The determination of the signiﬁcant features which co-vary with cluster membership was carried out on a post hoc basis. Bipartite spectral graph clustering simultaneously seeks groups of individual features which are strongly associated, even while seeking groups of sites which share subsets of these same features. We show that the application of this method results in clear and sensible geographical groupings and discuss and analyze the importance of the concomitant features.},

	abstract = {This book considers how languages have traditionally been divided into families, and asks how they should classified in the future. It describes and applies computer programs from biology and evolutionary genetics to data about languages and shows how the power of the computer can be harnessed to throw light on long-standing problems in historical linguistics. It tests current theories and hypotheses, shows how new ideas can be formulated, and offers a series of demonstrations that the new techniques applied to old data can produce convincing results that are sometimes startlingly at odds with accepted wisdom. April and Robert McMahon combine the expertise and perspectives of an historical linguist and a geneticist. They analyse the links between linguistic and population genetics, and consider how far language can be used to discover and understand the histories and interrelations of human populations. They explore the origins and formation of the Indo-European languages and examine less well studied languages in South America. Their book will be of great practical importance to students and researchers in historical and comparative linguistics and will interest all those concerned with the classification and diffusion of languages in fields such as archaeology, genetics, and anthropology. Its approachable style will appeal to general readers seeking to know more about the relationship between linguistic and human history.},

The ultimate goal is to identify cognates and correspondences directly from lists of words representing pairs of languages that are known to be related. The proposed solutions are language independent, and are evaluated against authentic linguistic data. The results of evaluation experiments involving the Indo-European, Algonquian, and Totonac language families indicate that our methods are more accurate than comparable programs, and achieve high precision and recall on various test sets.

Phonetic alignment plays a crucial role in the identiﬁcation of regular sound correspondences and deeper genealogical relations between and within languages and language families. Surprisingly, up to today, there are no easily accessible benchmark data sets for phonetic alignment analyses. Here we present a publicly available database of manually edited phonetic alignments which can serve as a platform for testing and improving the performance of automatic alignment algorithms. The database consists of a great variety of alignments drawn from a large number of diﬀerent sources. The data is arranged in a such way that typical problems encountered in phonetic alignment analyses (metathesis, diversity of phonetic sequences) are represented and can be directly tested.},

	title = {Conditional {Entropy} {Measures} {Intelligibility} among {Related} {Languages}},
	abstract = {The Scandinavian languages are so alike that their speakers often communicate, each using their own language, which Haugen (1966) dubbed SEMICOMMUNICATION. The success of semi-communication depends on the languages involved, and, moreover, can be asymmetric: for example, Swedish is more easily understandable for a Dane, than Danish for a Swede. It has been argued that non-linguistic factors could explain intelligibility, including its asymmetry. Gooskens (2006), however, found a high correlation between linguistic distance and intelligibility. This suggests that we need to seek linguistic factors that inﬂuence intelligibility, and that potentially asymmetric factors would be particularly interesting. Gooskens’ distance techniques cannot capture asymmetry. The present paper attempts to develop a model of the success of semi-communication based on conditional entropy, in particular using the conditional entropy of the phoneme mapping in corresponding (cognate) words. Semantically corresponding words were taken from frequency lists and aligned, and the conditional entropy of the phoneme mapping in aligned word pairs was calculated. This gives us information about the difﬁculty of predicting a phoneme in a native language given a corresponding phoneme in the foreign language. We also examine the conditional entropy of selected word classes, such as native/loan and function/content words.},

The focus here is on (i) an empirical approach, using an information-theoretical measure of mutual information, for deriving the appropriate segment distances to serve within measures of sequence distance; (ii) a heuristic technique for simultaneously aligning large sets of comparable pronunciations, a necessary step in applying phylogenetic analysis to sound segment data; (iii) spectral clustering, a technique borrowed from bio-informatics, for identifying the (linguistic) features responsible for (dialect) divisions among sites; (iv) techniques for studying the (mutual) comprehensibility of closely related varieties; and (v) Séguy’s law, or the generality of sub-linear diffusion of aggregate linguistic variation.},

	abstract = {In this study we examine linguistic variation and its dependence on both social and geographic factors. We follow dialectometry in applying a quantitative methodology and focusing on dialect distances, and social dialectology in the choice of factors we examine in building a model to predict word pronunciation distances from the standard Dutch language to 424 Dutch dialects. We combine linear mixed-effects regression modeling with generalized additive modeling to predict the pronunciation distance of 559 words. Although geographical position is the dominant predictor, several other factors emerged as significant. The model predicts a greater distance from the standard for smaller communities, for communities with a higher average age, for nouns (as contrasted with verbs and adjectives), for more frequent words, and for words with relatively many vowels. The impact of the demographic variables, however, varied from word to word. For a majority of words, larger, richer and younger communities are moving towards the standard. For a smaller minority of words, larger, richer and younger communities emerge as driving a change away from the standard. Similarly, the strength of the effects of word frequency and word category varied geographically. The peripheral areas of the Netherlands showed a greater distance from the standard for nouns (as opposed to verbs and adjectives) as well as for high-frequency words, compared to the more central areas. Our findings indicate that changes in pronunciation have been spreading (in particular for low-frequency words) from the Hollandic center of economic power to the peripheral areas of the country, meeting resistance that is stronger wherever, for well-documented historical reasons, the political influence of Holland was reduced. Our results are also consistent with the theory of lexical diffusion, in that distances from the Hollandic norm vary systematically and predictably on a word by word basis.},

Gabmap creates various views of dialect data, from histograms of characters used to spot coding errors, to alignments of phonetic transcriptions used in measuring pronunciation distance, to colored multi-dimensional scaling plots intended to illustrate quantitative results insightfully. Many analyses are accompanied by facilities allowing researchers to probe further, e.g. seeking the most important linguistic bases of an areal division, or examining the results of clustering for statistical reliability. These are also intended to inform the critical discussion of quantitative techniques, i.e. a comparision between quantitative analyses and non-quantitative (qualitative) work. For this reason Gabmap also includes support for qualitative analyses, such as facilities to map the occurrence of individual features. The software is in use, and the source code is openly available.},

	abstract = {Linguists have traditionally represented patterns of divergence within a language family in terms of either a ‘splits’ model, corresponding to a branching family tree structure, or the wave model, resulting in a (dialect) continuum. Recent phylogenetic analyses, however, have tended to assume the former as a viable idealization also for the latter. But the contrast matters, for it typically reflects different processes in the real world: speaker populations either separated by migrations, or expanding over continuous territory. Since history often leaves a complex of both patterns within the same language family, ideally we need a single model to capture both, and tease apart the respective contributions of each. The ‘network’ type of phylogenetic method offers this, so we review recent applications to language data. Most have used lexical data, encoded as binary or multi-state characters. We look instead at continuous distance measures of divergence in phonetics. Our output networks combine branch- and continuum-like signals in ways that correspond well to known histories (illustrated for Germanic, and particularly English). We thus challenge the traditional insistence on shared innovations, setting out a new, principled explanation for why complex language histories can emerge correctly from distance measures, despite shared retentions and parallel innovations.},

	isbn = {978-3-11-018284-2},
	shorttitle = {Perspectives on {Variation}},
	abstract = {The significant advances witnessed over the last years in the broad field of linguistic variation testify to a growing convergence between sociolinguistic approaches and the somewhat older historical and comparative research traditions. Particularly within cognitive and functional linguistics, the evolution towards a maximally dynamic approach to language goes hand in hand with a renewed interest in corpus research and quantitative methods of analysis. Many researchers feel that only in this way one can do justice to the complex interaction of forces and factors involved in linguistic variability, both synchronically and diachronically. The contributions to the present volume illustrate the ongoing evolution of the field. By bringing together a series of analyses that rely on extensive corpuses to shed light on sociolinguistic, historical, and comparative forms of variation, the volume highlights the interaction between these subfields. Most of the contributions go back to talks presented at the meeting of the Societas Linguistica Europaea held in Leuven in 2001. The volume starts with a global typological view on the sociolinguistic landscape of Europe offered by Peter Auer. It is followed by a methodological proposal for measuring phonetic similarity between dialects designed by Paul Heggarty, April McMahon, and Robert McMahon. Various papers deal with specific phenomena of socially and conceptually driven variation within a single language. For Dutch, José Tummers, Dirk Speelman, and Dirk Geeraerts analyze inflectional variation in Belgian and Netherlandic Dutch, Reinhild Vandekerckhove focuses on interdialectal convergence between West-Flemish urban dialects, and Arjan van Leuvensteijn studies competing forms of address in the 17th century Dutch standard variety. The cultural and conceptual dimension is also present in the diachronic lexicosemantic explorations presented by Heli Tissari, Clara Molina, and Caroline Gevaert for English expressions referring to the experiential domains of love, sorrow and anger, respectively: the history of words is systematically linked up with the images they convey and the evolving conceptualizations they reveal. The papers by Heide Wegener and by Marcin Kilarski and Grzegorz Krynicki constitute a plea against arbitrariness of alternations at the level of nominal morphology: dealing with marked plural forms in German, and with gender assignment to English loanwords in the Scandinavian languages, respectively, their distributional accounts bring into the picture a variety of motivating factors. The four cross-linguistic studies that close the volume focus on the differing ways in which even closely related languages exploit parallel morphosyntactic patterns. They share the same methodological concern for combining rigorous parametrization and quantification with conceptual and discourse-functional explanations. While Griet Beheydt and Katleen Van den Steen confront the use of formally defined competing constructions in two Germanic and two Romance languages, respectively, Torsten Leuschner as well as Gisela Harras and Kirsten Proost analyze how a particular speaker's attitude is expressed differently in various Germanic languages.},

This task involves three steps: (1) computing pairwise word distances, (2) aggregating word distances to a distance measure between languages and inferring a phylogenetic tree from these distances, and (3) evaluating the result by comparing it to expert classiﬁcations. For the ﬁrst task, weighted alignment will be used and a method to determine weights empirically will be presented. For the second task a novel method will be developed that attempts to minimize the bias resulting from missing data. For the third task, several methods from the literature will be applied to a large collection of language samples to enable statistical testing. It will be shown that the language distance measure proposed here leads to substantially more accurate phylogenies than a method relying on unweighted Levenshtein distances between words.},

We propose methods for detecting and quantifying three characteristics of cognates: recurrent sound correspondences, phonetic similarity, and semantic afﬁnity. The ultimate goal is to identify cognates and correspondences directly from lists of words representing pairs of languages that are known to be related. The proposed solutions are language independent, and are evaluated against authentic linguistic data. The results of evaluation experiments involving the Indo-European, Algonquian, and Totonac language families indicate that our methods are more accurate than comparable programs, and achieve high precision and recall on various test sets. The results also suggest that combining various types of evidence substantially increases cognate identiﬁcation accuracy.},
