Bipartite spectral graph co-clustering

introduced in \cite{dhillon2001co-clustering}

introduced as a method for dialect clustering in \cite{wieling2011bipartite}

\cite{wieling2013analyzing} applied this method for clustering British English dialects and compared the results to clusters obtained via PCA
 
\cite{montemagni2013synchronic} applied this method to Tuscan dialects and used left and right contexts for the sound segments

\cite{zha2001bipartite} introduced a similar (the same??) method as Dhillon at the same time, in another journal

% This algorithms and related ones were investigated by \cite{kluger2003spectral} for their use in bioinformatics as well (co-clustering genes and phenotypes).
 
\section{Data}

continental European West Germanic dialects and standard languages

intro to \cite{heggarty2018sound} and(?) \cite{listnodatebenchmark}

All of the entries were transcribed by Warren Maguire (with revisions by Paul Heggarty)

unable to use (modern doculect) data from both sources because of transcription differences

if I stick with BDPA: The only difference between "High German (Herrlisheim)" and "High German (North Alsace)" is a slightly different coverage of entries. They seem to be derived from the same wordlist of Heggarty's.

segmentation: affricates, diph-/triphthongs

\subsection{Alignments}

\section{Clustering}

\subsection{Bipartite spectral graph co-clustering}

The method, as taken from \cite{dhillon2001co-clustering}:

\begin{enumerate}
\item 
Given a (binary) co-occurrence matrix $A^{m \times n}$ ($m$ = number of doculects, $n$ = number of sound correspondences), normalize this matrix.
First, create two diagonal matrices $D_1^{m \times m}$ and $D_2^{n x n}$ that, respectively, contain the row sums/column sums of $A$.
Compute the diagonal matrices' inverses. 
% Since they are diagonal, this is very easy, but only possible if no entries on their diagonals are 0.
Then, compute the square roots of the inverses
% (also easy because of the diagonal structure)
.
Finally, create the normalized matrix $A_n = D_1^{-\frac{1}{2}} \times A \times D_2^{-\frac{1}{2}}$.
Effectively: divide each entry by the square root of the sum of its row's entries and by the square root of the sum of its column's entries.
This reduces the importance of doculects/correspondences that co-occur with a large number of other entries.

\item
Perform SVD on $A_n$ to get the left and right singular vectors $u_i$ and $v_i$.
We ignore the singular vectors belonging to the first/largest singular value, and take the second singular vectors ($u_2$, $v_2$).
(If clustering with $k > 2$, also skip the first singular vectors and take the $log(k)/log2$ following vectors.)
\cite{kluger2003spectral}: The first singular vectors only "make a trivial constant contribution to the matrix".
However, trying this out for the toy example in `wieling2011bipartite`, it is very much the case that when using the first singular vectors, the resulting vector (after step 3) contains the same value for all entries, being maximally unhelpful for k-means clustering (step 4).

\item
Calculate $D_1^{-\frac{1}{2}} \times u_2$ and $D_2^{-\frac{1}{2}} \times v_2$, and concatenate them to get the vector/matrix $Z$. 

\item
Perform k-means clustering on Z.

% \item
% If performing hierarchical clustering, repeat steps 1-4 on all clusters individually.
\end{enumerate}


\subsection{TF-IDF/SVD and k-means}

TF-IDF conceptually similar to first step of BSGC: adjusting feature frequencies by how informative they are

\begin{equation*}
\operatorname{tf-idf}(t, d) =
\frac{\text{number of occurrences of } t \text{ in } d}
{\text{number of tokens in } d}
\times
log
\frac{\text{number of documents}}
{\text{number of documents with } t}
\end{equation*}

\subsection{Ranking sound correspondences by importance}

Ranking the sound correspondences for each cluster
(BSGC: correspondences that are in the cluster,
TF-IDF: correspondences that are exhibited by the cluster's doculects)

introduced in \cite{wieling2011bipartite}

For each cluster, rank the associated sound correspondences by the following metrics:

\textbf{Representativeness}.
How many doculects in this cluster exhibit this sound correspondence?

\begin{equation*}
\operatorname{representativeness}(cluster_i, corres_j) = 
\frac{\text{number of doculects in } cluster_i \text{ with }  corres_j}
{\text{number of doculects in }  cluster_i}
\end{equation*}

\textbf{Distinctiveness}.
How often occurs a sound correspondence in this cluster compared to other clusters? 
This requires two additional measures: 

\begin{equation*}
\operatorname{relative\_occurrence}(cluster_i, corres_j) = 
\frac{\text{number of doculects in } cluster_i \text{ with }  corres_j}
{\text{total number of doculects with } corres_j}
\end{equation*}

and

\begin{equation*}
\operatorname{relative\_size}(cluster_i) = 
\frac{\text{number of doculects in } cluster_i}
{\text{total number of doculects}}
\end{equation*}

Then, 

\begin{equation*}
\operatorname{distinctiveness}(cluster_i, corres_j) = 
\frac{\operatorname{relative\_occurrence}(cluster_i, corres_j) - \operatorname{relative\_size}(cluster_i)}
{1 - \operatorname{relative\_size}(cluster_i)}
\end{equation*}

\textbf{Importance}
The average of representativeness and distinctiveness.

\begin{equation*}
\operatorname{importance}(cluster_i, corres_j) = 
\frac{\operatorname{representativeness}(cluster_i, corres_j) + \operatorname{distinctiveness}(cluster_i, corres_j)}
{2}
\end{equation*}

% TODO maybe: try out harmonic mean instead. I don't like how correspondences with low representativeness/distinctiveness but 100% of the other metric still get pretty high scores. Using the harmonic mean would give them a score closer to the lower score, I think.

According to \cite{wieling2010hierarchical}, the values of the second right singular vector are a good substitute for the above metrics.

\section{Results}

comparison with language ancestry data from \cite{hammarstrom2018glottolog}

comparison of highest-ranked sound correspondences
(+ example words?)

effect of context information

comparison with sound shifts (e.g. High German consonant shift)

\section{Discussion}

% -- specific ---

is the context beneficial?

How beneficial is co-clustering really? Why not just cluster the doculects (after TF-IDF maybe) and then apply the sound correspondence metrics? It seems like the benefit of co-clustering is mainly that $v_2$ can be used for ranking the correspondences, although this doesn't seem to be very popular among the authors who used bipartite spectral graph clustering for dialect data...

comparison to the results discussed in \cite{wieling2011bipartite}
They remark on a common alignment [-]:[\textesh], which commonly appears after [t]:[t]. Interpreting affricates as single segments with the result of correspondences such as [t]:[\t{t\textesh}], or using another approach to include contextual information seems more satisfying to me.

% --- more general ---

All of the comparisons here are phonetic (and might possibly include some morphological information in some cases) and on a word level, but we are ignoring lexical, syntactical, morphological, etc. information in this analysis.

To what extend does clustering dialects and/or applying a hierarchical model to dialect data make sense? (tree vs. web, `vertical' changes vs. `horizontal' influences)
data is from a relatively large region though
